# NYC Citi Bike Share Analysis: August 2019 
## Overview
For this review, we analyzed New York City Citi Bike Share Data from August 2019 to determine the possibility of having a bikeshare program in Des Moines, Iowa.

## Methodology

For this study, we sourced data from the NYC Citi BikeShare Database, used Jupyter Notebook to better interpret the data, and Tableau to then visiualze the data.

1) As you can see from the Usershare pie chart, the majority of users are subscribers. This is an indication of a loyal following of riders. There are nearly 2 million subscribers compared to the near 500,000 regular customers. It would be in the best interest of Citi Bike to increase subscribership.

2) August Peak Hours would suggest that there are more riders towards the end of the evening, around 6-8pm, which makes sense given the longer days of the month of August. There is also a fair share of riders in the morning commuting hours, which may indicate that riders use bikes to get to and from work.

3) This graph shows a couple of things: It shows that the majority of riders are male and that most riders ride Citi BIkes for less than 20 minutes.

4) This heatmap indicates similarly to the August Peak Hours graph showing that during the weekdays, most ridership occurs before and after working hours. However, interestingly, this map also indicates a more spreadout user of ridership during the weekend days.

5) The next two heatmaps also indicate similar results to checkout times by gender. It shows that ridership is shared more amongst men and that peak hours are still Mon-Friday from 7am-9am and 6-8pm and on weekends throughout the day.

6) This last graphic interestingly shows that the majority of male subscribers take out Citi Bikes more towards the end of the work week.

### Conlusions

  - Subscribers use the Citi Bike service more than regular customers and it would be worth investing in getting more subscribers into the program. 
  - During the weekday commuting hours of 7-9am and 6-8pm ridership is at it's peak. During the weekend days, ridership is more evenly spreadout throughout the day. There may be some consideration to be made for more avaialability of bikes during peak hours depending on where heavily trafficked areas are.
  - There is generally more male ridership than female ridership in NYC, which is interesting compared to the fact that there are more women to men in New York City.
  - Based on the data that we observed here, we can confidently say that summer months is where you see a higher proportion of ridership amongst New Yorkers.

### Suggestions
  - It might be interesting to look at population density as compared to ridership to see if more users are in heavily populated areas of New York City
  - Find ways to incentivize customers to become subscribers because it seems as though there is a strong loyalty in subscribership.
  - Look into the gender gap in ridership and see why more females are not using Citi Bike.
